# ðŸŒ² tvs-docker

An alpine-based terraria server container & compose template; based on [`hexlo/terraria-server-docker`](https://github.com/hexlo/terraria-server-docker).

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Clients and server must be running compatible versions of Terraria to connect.

- `docker` or compatible engine
  - `docker compose` or equivalent is recommended

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration

The majorify of the configuration is handled through the `server-config.conf` file, which is loaded by the server on boot; an example of which can be found in [`server-config.conf`](config/server-config.conf).

Here's a quick breakdown of each of these settings:

| :----- | :---------- | :----- |
| `world` | Absolute or Relative Path to worldfile to be loaded | `name.wld` or `/path/to/name.wld` |

For additional information on configuration options, please visit [the wiki](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Setting_up_a_Terraria_server#Making_a_configuration_file).
In addition, [`terrariaconfig.dotslashsteve.sh`](https://terrariaconfig.dotslashsteve.sh/) can be used to generate a config file for you.

### ðŸ“¨ Environment Variables

Breaking from the original project, this fork only provides a single environment variable for configuration:

| Variable | Default Value | Description | Example |
| :------- | :------------ | :---------- | :------ |
| `TERRARIA_VERSION` | `latest` | Specify the semver version of Terraria to install, or `latest` to use the most recent version | `1.4.4.9` or `latest` |

## ðŸŒŽ World Generation

World generation is recommended to be defined in the configuration file; however this can also be done manually.  For more information, please visit [the wiki](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Setting_up_a_Terraria_server).

## ðŸ’» Console Commands

Please refer to the [official wiki](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Server#List_of_console_commands) for what console-commands are available.

Unfortunately, these cannot be entered in-game, and requires attaching to the container directly.  When doing so, ensure `<C-p><C-q>` is used to detach from the container without stopping the process.
